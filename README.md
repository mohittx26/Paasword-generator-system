🔐 Paasword-Generator-System

This is a simple and user-friendly Password Generator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
The main goal of this project is to help users create strong and secure passwords easily, without using any external tools or software.

I built this project to practice JavaScript logic, understand how browsers handle random values, and design a clean frontend interface.

😊 Why I Built This Project

In daily life, many people still use weak or repeated passwords, which can be unsafe.
So I created this small tool that can instantly generate random and strong passwords, making it easier for users to stay secure online.

This project is also part of my learning journey in frontend development.

🧠 How This Password Generator Works (In Simple Words)

You open the website in your browser.

You choose how long you want your password to be.

When you click the Generate button:

JavaScript randomly picks characters

It mixes letters, numbers, and symbols

A strong password appears on the screen.

You can copy it and use it anywhere you want.

Everything happens inside the browser, so your password is never stored or shared.

✨ Features
